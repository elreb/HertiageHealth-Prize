# Hertiage Health Prize - A Kaggle Data Science Competition

Heritage Health Prize was a Kaggle competition with a $500,000 prize with the goal of identifying patients who will be admitted to a hospital within the next year using historical claims data. The data was three years worth of insurance claims data across 6 datasets. 

This was an analysis I did as apart of a Big Data In Public Health course while I was a graduatate student at UC Berkeley. In my analyses I used R to summarize some of the information, then attempted to make and combine some of the datasets. However, ran into some computations due to the procedural nature of R. So I loaded up an instance of Postgres to decrease compuational strain with set theory. I ended up using Gradient Boosted Machine algorithm for prediction and scored moderately well on the Kaggle Scoreboard.
